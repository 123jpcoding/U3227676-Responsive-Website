                    <h1>Our History</h1>
                    <p>Judo, meaning ‘gentle way’, is a modern Japanese martial art and Olympic combat sport (Budokan
                        Judo
                        Club Australia, 2022). The sport is competitive, with an objective to “cleanly
                        throw, to pin, or to master one’s opponent, the latter being done by applying pressure to arm
                        joints
                        or to the neck to cause the opponent to yield” (Burdick, 2018).

                        Marist Judo Club operates on a basis
                        that Judo is for everyone, meaning the club caters
                        to children, teenagers and adults alike at all ability
                        levels. Marist Judo has fully qualified coaches and teach on Monday and Wednesday evenings.
                        There
                        are two separate training sessions, with a Junior class focused on children aged 8-12, and a
                        Senior
                        lesson training teens, young adults and adults. Marist Judo Club is an affiliated member of Judo
                        ACT
                        and the Australian Judo Federation, meaning students can participate in competitions held
                        throughout
                        the year by those bodies.
