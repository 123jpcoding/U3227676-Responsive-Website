# Project 1: Responsive Website

This assignment involved building a functional website using HTML5 and CSS for the Contour 556 website. To begin this project, I first had to consider the function and target demographic of the site. As discussed during tutorials, the function of the Contour 556 website, is to promote the Canberra Art Biennale festival to Canberrans. Their primary demographic consists of upper to upper-middle class citizens with a higher education. This audience is skewed older, as they require both free time and a sincere appreciation for arts and culture. The new design therefore, must accommodate this audience, with a clear and effective interface that is easy to operate. 

Having established the function and demographic, I proceeded to study the current design of Contour 556. This allowed me to recognise what had to be changed for a more effective website. This process evolved into creating sketches, as I decided to remove or streamline certain information. For instance, I chose to combine the ‘Supporters’ and ‘Donation’ pages, as well as the ‘About’ and ‘People’ pages, due to the similar content. Similarly, I entirely removed the ‘News’, ‘City Commissions’ and ‘Covid’ pages, as I felt they were either dated or irrelevant to the primary function of the website. The designs themselves are quite generic, with the layout of each page derived from current web trends. The sketches also featured elements such as hero content, call-to-action buttons, a map, photo galleries and a navigation bar. I considered a photo gallery and location information particularly important, as the entire purpose of the festival, and subsequently the website, is to promote the art placed around Canberra. Contour 556 additionally incorporates a vibrant pink within their marketing, however, I opted to use yellow and blue for the new design, as I consider these colours calmer and more appropriate for the demographic. 

During the coding segment of the project, my process involved writing the HTML, before proceeding with the CSS and the Javascript where necessary. The most difficult aspect of this assignment was the layout of the text, particularly ensuring that it was responsive. I therefore worked in sections, regularly checking the code was operating as it should, before trying to make a new element. Occasionally, if a particular new segment was ruining the website, I would ‘comment’ out the code and test to see what was wrong. 

I had previously made a Navigation bar, however I had never incorporated a dropdown menu. This took some practice and persistence, as the prior ‘ul’ and ‘li’ styling often interfered with the new CSS I was trying to add to the drop down menu. I realised however, the usefulness of classes, as they allowed me to merge and isolate certain features across multiple divs. Similarly making the navigation bar responsive was difficult, however I opted to make a hamburger menu. This meant making the list items vertical, incorporating icons as well as a sliding rectangle which would act as the navigation for mobile devices. I also struggled with the about page, as I wanted to format the information and images regarding ‘The Team’ in two columns. There were issues however, due to the text being differing lengths and the images not aligning as they were intended. This was resolved however, as I again operated through research, as well as trial and error.

Creating a donation form was initially daunting, however there were multiple sources that provided inspiration and guidance on the best approaches to incorporating the ‘input’ tag, and formatting each div in an effective way. 

Throughout this coding process, I had to compromise some of my initial ideas, as I was either unsure how to properly implement them, or I preferred a different design in the moment. For instance, I had originally planned to include a horizontal media scroller that would feature the News. However I was unsure about the best approach for coding this, and realised that the News segment was not entirely necessary given Contour 556 has a newsletter and social media platforms. My initial sketches were additionally altered, as I decided to change aesthetic choices such as the placement and size of images and text. If I were to complete this assignment again, I would predominantly focus on fixing the mistakes and perfecting the details. I would fix the spacing on certain pages, as some segments are too separated from one another. I would either make a new logo, or use the redesigned Contour 556 one, as I feel the one used on the site is too small and could be improved. My main discrepancies however are with the image gallery. Given more time and effort, I would adjust the images to all be equal in size, or otherwise fix the overlay to be the same size as the image. The current gallery I have made is functional, however I think having this consistency would have elevated the design. Similarly I noticed another student had considered the mobile users more thoroughly, and had altered the gallery to show information without a hover effect. I would also incorporate a slideshow on each individual artists’ page, thereby properly showcasing their artworks on the site. I used the W3schools Validator in order to correct my coding errors. This process was very necessary as I had a number of issues I was not aware of. For instance, I had forgotten to incorporate ‘alt’ text for my logo image. I had also named many of my image assets with spaces, which is illegal and had to be changed for the final site. One problem that I did not immediately understand how to resolve, was an error declaring there was a stray footer start tag. I eventually realised that the tag was outside the end </body> tag and therefore was in a context where no elements can be started. The code also had many unnecessary end tags that had to be removed, as they had no correlating open tag. 

Overall, I think the website I have provided is clean, with a cohesive colour palette and simple page layouts that consider the target demographic. I appreciate the reduction of pages, as the site now appears to prioritise the festival, the artwork and the donations as the primary intentions of Contour 556. I learnt many new techniques, primarily regarding image galleries, web layout and responsive coding. Whilst I may not have included all my initial ideas, I think the final product is a successful website that achieves its intended goals.
