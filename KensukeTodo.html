            <h3> ABOUT THE WORK</h3>
            <p>Kensuke Todo was born and grew up in Kyoto, Japan. He studied a Bachelor of Visual Artin Sculpture at
                Kyoto Seika University and first travelled to Australia in 1999 as an exchange student at Canberra
                School
                of Art and Design, AustralianNational University. He later returned there to study his Masters degree.
                Todohas lived and worked in Canberra since 2004. He has shown his sculptures nationally and
                internationally in numerous group and solo exhibitions. A major survey exhibition of his work was held
                at
                the ANU Drill Hall Gallery in 2014.</p>

            <p>One day, playing with my children in the overgrown front yard of our house, my son cried out, “Dad, I
                found a big rock!” He was seven years old. A small, skinny boy, holding a big rock in his arm and
                walking
                towards me. I quickly retrieved the rock from him before he dropped it on his foot. The rock was very
                heavy, much heavier than I expected. Soon I realized how much my son had grown and how strong he was.
            </p>

            <p>The rock sculptures are kind of self-portrait. While making them, I imagined myselfcurled in the rock
                that he was carrying.</p>
